### **Data Analysis Notes Repository**

This repository contains personal notes and code snippets for data analysis, focusing on three core languages: **Python**, **R**, and **SQL**. The purpose of this collection is to serve as a quick reference guide for common tasks, techniques, and concepts in the data analysis workflow.

### **Key Sections**

* **Python:** Notes cover essential libraries for data manipulation and visualization, including **pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib/Seaborn**. Topics range from basic data cleaning and transformation to more advanced topics like regression analysis and machine learning.
   * Data Manipulation
   * Data Cleaning
   * [Categorical Data](https://github.com/DavidRommel/Notes/blob/main/Python_Categorical_Data/README.md)
   * [Long and Wide Data](https://github.com/DavidRommel/Notes/blob/main/Python_Long_Wide_Data/README.md)
   * Data Visualization (Basic Graphs)
   * Data Visualization (Choropleth Maps)
   * [Data Visualization (Slopegraphs)](https://github.com/DavidRommel/Notes/blob/main/Python_Slopegraphs/README.md)
   * Statistical Testing
   * Linear Regression
   * Multiple Regression
   * Logistic Regression
   * Supervised Machine Learning
   * Unsupervised Machine Learning

* **R:** This section includes notes on key R packages like **dplyr** for data manipulation and **ggplot2** for data visualization. It covers data wrangling techniques, statistical analysis, and creating high-quality plots.

  * [Data Visualization (Slopegraphs)](https://github.com/DavidRommel/Notes/tree/main/R_Slopegraphs/README.md)

* **SQL:** Notes here focus on structuring and querying relational databases. They cover foundational concepts like `SELECT`, `FROM`, and `WHERE` clauses, as well as more complex operations such as joins, subqueries, and window functions. The notes are applicable to various SQL dialects (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL).
  * [Create Row Numbers](https://github.com/DavidRommel/Notes/blob/main/SQL_Create_Row_Numbers/README.md)
