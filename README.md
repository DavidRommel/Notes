### **Data Analysis Notes Repository**

This repository contains personal notes and code snippets for data analysis, focusing on three core languages: **Python**, **R**, and **SQL**. The purpose of this collection is to serve as a quick reference guide for common tasks, techniques, and concepts in the data analysis workflow.

### **Key Sections**

* **Python:** Notes cover essential libraries for data manipulation and visualization, including **pandas**, **NumPy**, and **Matplotlib/Seaborn**. Topics range from basic data cleaning and transformation to more advanced topics like time series analysis and machine learning fundamentals.
   * [Slopegraphs](https://github.com/DavidRommel/Notes/blob/main/Python_Slopegraphs/README.md)

* **R:** This section includes notes on key R packages like **dplyr** for data manipulation and **ggplot2** for data visualization. It covers data wrangling techniques, statistical analysis, and creating high-quality plots.
  * [Slopegraphs](https://github.com/DavidRommel/Notes/tree/main/R_Slopegraphs/README.md)
  * [Factors](https://github.com/DavidRommel/Notes/blob/main/R_Factors/README.md)
  * [Long and Wide Data](https://github.com/DavidRommel/Notes/blob/main/R_Long_Wide_Data/README.md)

* **SQL:** Notes here focus on structuring and querying relational databases. They cover foundational concepts like `SELECT`, `FROM`, and `WHERE` clauses, as well as more complex operations such as joins, subqueries, and window functions. The notes are applicable to various SQL dialects (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL).
  * [Create Row Numbers](https://github.com/DavidRommel/Notes/blob/main/SQL_Create_Row_Numbers/README.md)
